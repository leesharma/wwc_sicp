## Meetings

Our meetings are **alternating Mondays, 6:30 pm @ [Mom & Pop's][map] in the
Mosaic District**.

We're aiming for biweekly in-person meetings to discuss the reading (see the
[tentative schedule](#tentative-schedule) for specific dates). Most of our
communicaton between meetings will happen in the Women Who Code DC Slack #sicp
channel.

*Getting There:* Mom & Pop's is less than a mile from the
Dunn-Loring/Merrifield Metro Station (orange line), and there are several free
parking garages in Mosaic District.
