# *Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs*

This is the GitHub page for our *Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs* (SICP) reading group. It serves as a central source for our meeting

## Meetings

Our meetings are **alternating Mondays, 6:30 pm @ [Whole Foods Market][map] in
Falls Church**.

We're aiming for biweekly in-person meetings to discuss the reading (see the
[tentative schedule](#tentative-schedule) for specific dates). Most of our
communicaton between meetings will happen in the Women Who Code DC Slack #sicp
channel.

*Getting There:* There's a big parking lot right in front of store, and it's
right on the 28A and 3T metro bus routes.
