(sqrt 0.000004)
=> .03129261341049664
; correct answer = 0.002
; This is due to the delta being much larger than the numbers
; being searched for, so a range of numbers that is much larger
; than the provided parameter will all satisfy the test.

(sqrt 9999999999998)
; The average lacks sufficient precision for the difference to continue
; to get smaller, meaning that the guess will never converge.
